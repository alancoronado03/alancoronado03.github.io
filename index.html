              <h3>Birthday Paradox Simulator</h3>
              <p>
               The Birthday Paradox, is a famous statistical problem that demonstrates how likely it is for at least two people in a group to share the same birthday. As a result, 
               the probabilty increases exponentially as the number of people in a room increases reaching a percentage of almost 50% at a low number such as 23 people. This result is quite intriguing due to the way that the probabilities
               work since there is almost a guaranteed repeat throughout 75% of the whole statistical experiment. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The purpose of this project was to replicate
                the birthday paradox through creation of 4 classes to emulate this behavior. Through this interworking classes we set the goal to randomize in the most accurate way possible the birthday generation by 
                setting out the goal of performing 1 experiment per sample size. These sample sizes started off at 5 people and incremented by 5 all the way to a max of 100 by producing individual trials at each interval at least 20 times and then recording those results. 
                
              </p>
              <p>
                For this project, I employed Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure that each class and method was test properly before final implementation. 
                At the same time, I produced JUnit tests to validate both correct functionality and edge cases. At the same time, I learned new testing practices such as the implementation of the Mockito dependency to simulate controlled scenarios to ensure the system would behave as expected under
                different conditions. Finally, the design, implemention, testing and refactoring of the project was done my implementing industry-standard paired programming practices throughout every step of the process. 
                 
              </p>
              <p>
              I gained hands-on experience with statistical simulations through the replication of these experiment. At the same time, I greatly improved my testing practices
              specifically by writing effective unit tests, especially for scenarios involving random data and edge cases. However, the main take away from this project was implementing Test-Driven Development skills helped me develop code in a systematic, reliable manner. Furthermore, 
              the use of dependencies such as JUnit and Mockito for unit testing allowed me to learn more about specific conditions in the testing and implementations components of TDD.

            <h3>Elevator Simulator</h3>
            <p>
             The Elevator Simulator project is a project that models the movement of different types of elevators throughout a multi-floor building. It is designed with the goal of replicating the real-world behaviors of an elevator such as pick-up and drop-off of passengers, handling multiple calls
              and movement between floors and different directions. The purpose of this project was to implement design, testing and ultimately coding practices used in a real-world professional setting. While at the same time, highlighting the complex inherit structures within elevators themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              This simulator takes in various input such as a list of elevators, a list of calls and overall simulate the movement of 4 different kinds of elevators: Standard, Penthouse, Freight, and Express throughout a building. The movements, floors, directional states, occupancy and calls are tracked every round floor by floor.
              The simulation will ultimately output these results round by round with the calls passed in to the elevators being dictated by two different types of schedulers. These schedulers each had a unique set of rules that they ahd to follow in regards to the process of assigning calls with one being the Simple Scheduler and the other
              a Complex scheduler focused on efficiency.

            </p>
            <p>
             The design of this project was done following industry standard object-oriented programming principles. Some of these include: encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and SOLID principles. All of which were used in each step of the process from the design
              to the ultimate implementation of the functionality of the project. Furthermore, in regards to the actual implementation the goal of this simulator was to use Test-Driven Development throughout the entire process to practice clean code principles, reusability, flexibility and
              professionalism. Finally, there was a huge emphasis based around the design process and the assurance of Single Responsibilty being met throughout the project which allowed for the simualtor to be easy to maintain, test, debug, and refactor.

            </p>
            <p>
              My contribution to this project was the design, testing and implementation of the Standard and penthouse elevator along with the simple scheduler and finally the simulation class. I had to ensure that both of the elevator classes performed accordingly to the strict rules that
              guided their movement and decision making, as well as occupancy tracking and idle-logic. The design of these classes was done following strict TDD ensuring unit tests were written first allowing for easy debugging and simplified implementations. Furthermore, Simple Scheduler and the Simulation class also followed TDD although they were slightly more complex.
              Each of these were standalone and easy to test, however, their full implementations were dependent on other components of the project so ensuring each class and its methods and variables followed clean code principles, Single responsiblity, and other SOLID principles was crucial for them to work. Finally, for the full integration of the test
              integration tests were made to ensure cohesion and unity throughout each component making regular pull requests and code reviews through Github to maintain clean code and working on project design from start to finish
            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, this project was a great opportunity to work on Test Driven Development within the scope of a complex object-oriented project. At the same time, I learned a lot about object-oriented principles and their useful implementations to reduce redundancy and improve scalablilty.While at the
            same time, navigating through the production process using Github pull requests and code reviews to ensure the development of a project that met professional grade standards.

        <h3>Timely Planner App </h3>
        <p>
          Timely, is a calendar and task application that allows users to seamlessly and efficiently organize their busy schedules
          and visually keep track of them. The purpose of this project was to find a solution for people with busy schedules by helping them keep their schedules and daily tasks organized and secured in one location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Timely is made up of three main components, the calendar, the task list, and finally the progress chart. We followed the MVC Object oriented design principle to facilitate all the facets of our project. The calendar is designed to allow users to create, remove, and edit events throughout their
          day that they are then able to label as either a time block or an all day event. On the other hand, the task list or to-do list is a unique feature that allows the user to add either personal or school tasks to their to-do list which integrates to the third and final component, the progress chart. The
          progress chart is a visual representation of the users tasks throughout the day and will display different colors as a pie chart does to show the uncompleted and completed percentage of an indivdual's tasks throughout the day.

        </p>
        <p>
          Timely is a JavaFX-based calendar and task management application designed with a modular, object-oriented architecture. The project features a dynamic, interactive calendar interface that allows users to create, edit, and remove events categorized as either All-Day or Time-Block. Using inheritance and interfaces, the backend supports flexible task and event structures, while the frontend is built using responsive JavaFX layouts. The application employs the Observer pattern to keep all views—calendar, to-do list, and progress tracker—in sync with the central data model. I developed this project using test-driven development to ensure core reliability and maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          My contribution to this project was the back-end components that regulated the adding, removing, and editing of the event classes. Additionally, I focused on the visual and technical creation of the calendar and the skeleton of the UI application. I used different components from the JavaFX framework
          to create an interactive calendar that responded to user interaction and connected to the backend components of our project to ensure observers and the controllers were all updated and notified when needed.
        </p>
        </p>
        Finally, this project was a great opportunity to work on Test Driven Development within the scope of a complex object-oriented project. At the same time, I learned a lot about object-oriented principles and their useful implementations to reduce redundancy and improve scalablilty.While at the
        same time, navigating through the production process using Github pull requests and code reviews to ensure the development of a project that met professional grade standards. Furthermore, using a framework such as JavaFx was a very useful learning experience as this was my first time working with UI in Java. The
        experience overall was very rewarding and working on this project from start to end was very insightful and taught me a lot about time-sensitive problem-solving, task management, and project development. g
